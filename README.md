# Restaurant Database Management System

This is a repository for a restaurant database management system created using SQL. The purpose of this project was to gain experience in database design and implementation, as well as to create a useful tool for managing restaurant-related data.

The files are:

Tables of data used to populate the Restaurant database ([contents of the csvs folder]())

Two versions of the Restaurant database for various software tools ([restaurant.sql]() and [restaurant_sqlite.db]())

A listing of the commands that I used to work with the database ([queries.md]())

## Getting Started
To use this database management system, you need to have access to a SQL server and a client that can connect to it. The SQL script for creating the database can be found in the restaurant.sql file. You can execute this script in your SQL client to create the database, tables, and relationships. Once you have created the database, you can use the sample data files to populate the tables with example data.

## Features
The restaurant database includes tables for restaurants, menus, and customer orders. The restaurants table contains information about each restaurant, such as its name, location, and contact details. The menus table contains information about each menu item, such as its name, description, and price. The orders table contains information about each customer order, such as the date, time, and total cost.

## Usage
The database can be used to manage restaurant-related data, such as menus, customer orders, employee data, inventory levels, and sales data. The database management system includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows restaurant staff to interact with the database and perform functions such as adding or removing menu items, taking customer orders, and generating reports. The use of SQL allows for efficient data management and analysis, enabling restaurant owners and managers to make data-driven decisions and improve business performance.
